    "description": "Pretexting is one of the most powerful and versatile tools in the social engineer’s arsenal. Whether used in red teaming, penetration testing, or adversary simulation, a well-crafted pretext can bypass even the most hardened security controls—not through technical exploits, but by leveraging trust, authority, and human psychology.\n\nIn this two-hour interactive workshop, we will dive deep into the art and science of pretexting, exploring its historical roots, ethical considerations, and real-world applications in offensive security. Participants will gain hands-on experience in developing layered personas, crafting believable scenarios, and executing pretexts across multiple attack surfaces, including phishing campaigns, vishing (voice phishing), and physical infiltration techniques.",
