      "content": "We're looking for workshops and tactics for our DEF CON 33 event! If you're interested in hosting a workshop or sharing a tactic, please fill out the workshop form linked below.\n\nIdeal workshops provide structured, hands-on learning experiences led by an instructor. Meanwhile, tactics are short, self-guided activities that attendees can try out at their own pace in our less formal environmentâ€”perfect for demonstrating quick techniques, tool usage, or security concepts that can be completed in 10-20 minutes. These asynchronous activities allow participants to engage with practical offensive security skills in a drop-in format throughout the conference.\n\nWhether you're a seasoned professional with a comprehensive workshop or have a clever tactical exercise worth sharing, we encourage you to submit your proposal. Selected presenters will have the opportunity to share their expertise with hundreds of passionate security practitioners in our dedicated village space at DEF CON 33. Submit your workshop or tactics proposal soon, as selection will be competitive!",
