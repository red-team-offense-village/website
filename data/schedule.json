      "description": "We're thrilled to launch RTV CRON, our new recurring series where cybersecurity meets community! We'll have a live workshop and we'll also be discussing the latest news in the village.\n\nThis month, we'll be joined by Jeff Tomkiewicz to discuss the art of Pretexting. Pretexting is one of the most powerful and versatile tools in the social engineer’s arsenal. Whether used in red teaming, penetration testing, or adversary simulation, a well-crafted pretext can bypass even the most hardened security controls—not through technical exploits, but by leveraging trust, authority, and human psychology.\n\nIn this two-hour interactive workshop, we will dive deep into the art and science of pretexting, exploring its historical roots, ethical considerations, and real-world applications in offensive security. Participants will gain hands-on experience in developing layered personas, crafting believable scenarios, and executing pretexts across multiple attack surfaces, including phishing campaigns, vishing (voice phishing), and physical infiltration techniques.",
