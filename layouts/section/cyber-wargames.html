            There will be multiple scoring periods during each event. Each team is battling for control of a single set of systems and services. The attacking team will only gain points for maintaining control of a <b>functional</b> service - <i>destroying the service will award them nothing.</i>

          <p class="text-gray-700 my-2">

            This event is a free-for-all between 4 teams competing against each other to gain points by controlling services and flags within their own, and each opponents, infrastructure.
            That means your team will have to balance defending your own systems, while simultaneously hunting for vulnerabilities that can be exploited to control other teams' systems.
