          <p class="text-gray-700">
            Teams are tasked with protecting their systems and services while identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities on other team's systems in this Redteam free-for-all. Points will be awarded for controlling services and flags within their own, and each opponents, infrastructure.

          <p class="text-gray-700">
            Strategic Operations will feature two teams going head to head in a classic offense vs defense battle.

            Contestants will access a virtual environment with dynamic challenges that need to be exploited and contested. Individuals gain points for each system they are able to plant and maintain their flag on.

          <p class="text-gray-700 my-2">
            There will be multiple scoring periods during each event. Each team is battling for control of a single set of systems and services. The attacking team will only gain points for maintaining control of a <b>functional</b> service - <i>destroying the service will award them nothing.</i>

          <p class="text-gray-700 my-2">
            This event is designed with beginners and experts alike in mind. Multiple scenarios will allow for a wide range of skill levels to compete, and replayability for teams if desired.

            Teams will defend their "Castle," a virtual environment comprising several systems and services (both Windows and Linux systems may be included). Each castle has exposed services and exploitable vulnerabilities, along with a few hidden extras.

          <p class="text-gray-700 my-2">
            This event is a free-for-all between 4 teams competing against each other to gain points by controlling services and flags within their own, and each opponents, infrastructure.
            That means your team will have to balance defending your own systems, while simultaneously hunting for vulnerabilities that can be exploited to control other teams' systems.
